# Meanintor
An Android app to learn English vocabulary with an emphasis on multiple definitions, synonyms, and opposites for a single word, as well as interval learning, spaced repetition and testing.

For the longest time I wanted to rewrite what [Artemii Kolomiichuk](https://github.com/ArtemiiKolomiichuk/) and I had done for research practice at NaUKMA with better understanding of Kotlin and use of Jetpack Compose.
You can see what original code looked like [here](https://github.com/ArtemiiKolomiichuk/Meanintor-Android) but I strongly ask you not to.
